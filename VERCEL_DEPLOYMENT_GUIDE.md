# üöÄ Vercel Deployment Guide for Cropwise

## üìã Before Deploying

### ‚úÖ What Will Work After Deployment:

1. **Admin Login**: You'll be able to log into your admin account (`Chibuikeemmanuel879@gmail.com`) with password `Emma22##`
2. **Existing Products**: All 8 products will be visible
3. **Existing Users**: Both users will be able to log in
4. **New User Registration**: New users can register and access all features
5. **Data Persistence**: All data persists across deployments

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Firebase Setup Required

Your app needs Firebase credentials on Vercel to persist data. Without it, data resets on each redeployment.

---

## üîß Step 1: Get Firebase Credentials from Your serviceAccountKey.json

Open your `serviceAccountKey.json` file and copy these 3 values:

```json
{
  "project_id": "cropwise-f602d",
  "client_email": "firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc@cropwise-f602d.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIEvQIBADANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAASCBKcwggSjAgEAAoIBAQCPKdL0wCuTHOgc\n..."
}
```

You need:
- `project_id` 
- `client_email`
- `private_key` (the ENTIRE key including `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END PRIVATE KEY-----`)

---

## üîê Step 2: Add Environment Variables to Vercel

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
3. Add these 3 variables:

   **Variable 1:**
   - **Name**: `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
   - **Value**: `cropwise-f602d`
   - **Environment**: Production, Preview, Development (select all)

   **Variable 2:**
   - **Name**: `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL`
   - **Value**: `firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc@cropwise-f602d.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
   - **Environment**: Production, Preview, Development (select all)

   **Variable 3:**
   - **Name**: `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY`
   - **Value**: (Copy the ENTIRE `private_key` value from serviceAccountKey.json, including the BEGIN and END markers)
   - **Environment**: Production, Preview, Development (select all)

   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important for PRIVATE_KEY**: When copying, make sure to include the newlines (`\n`). Vercel will handle this automatically, but if you see issues, you can copy the entire key as a single line.

4. **Also add your existing environment variables:**
   - `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` = (your OpenRouter API key)

5. Click **Save** after adding each variable

---

## üöÄ Step 3: Deploy to Vercel

### Option A: Deploy from GitHub (Recommended)

1. Push your code to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add Firebase Firestore integration"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Go to Vercel dashboard ‚Üí Your project ‚Üí **Deployments**
3. Click **Redeploy** (or it will auto-deploy if connected to GitHub)

### Option B: Deploy via Vercel CLI

```bash
vercel --prod
```

---

## ‚úÖ Step 4: Verify Deployment

After deployment:

1. **Check Logs**: Go to Vercel ‚Üí Your deployment ‚Üí **Functions** ‚Üí Click on a function ‚Üí **Logs**
   - You should see: `‚úÖ Firebase Admin initialized successfully`
   - You should see: `‚úÖ Loaded X users from Firestore` (after first migration)

2. **Test Admin Login**:
   - Go to your deployed URL
   - Login with: `Chibuikeemmanuel879@gmail.com` / `Emma22##`
   - You should see admin controls

3. **Check Products**:
   - Navigate to Products page
   - All 8 products should be visible

4. **Test New User Registration**:
   - Register a new user
   - Verify they can login and see products

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Step 5: Initial Data Migration

On **first deployment** with Firebase, your existing data will be automatically migrated:

- The app detects if Firestore is empty
- It reads from JSON files (for backup/migration)
- Copies all data to Firestore
- You'll see migration logs in Vercel logs

**After migration**, all new data goes directly to Firestore.

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Firebase initialization failed"

**Solution**: 
- Check that all 3 environment variables are set correctly
- Make sure `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY` includes the full key with BEGIN/END markers
- Verify the keys are set for the correct environment (Production/Preview)

### Problem: Data not persisting

**Solution**:
- Check Vercel logs for Firebase errors
- Verify environment variables are saved
- Make sure you redeployed after adding environment variables

### Problem: Admin can't login / Products not showing

**Solution**:
- Check if initial migration ran (check Vercel logs)
- If migration didn't happen, you may need to manually add initial data to Firestore
- Or temporarily remove JSON files from `.gitignore` for first deployment, then add them back

### Problem: Fallback to JSON files

**Solution**:
- This means Firebase isn't initialized
- Check environment variables are correct
- Check Vercel logs for specific error messages

---

## üìä What Happens After Deployment:

### ‚úÖ With Firebase Set Up:
- ‚úÖ Admin can login immediately
- ‚úÖ All products visible
- ‚úÖ New users can register
- ‚úÖ All data persists across redeployments
- ‚úÖ No data loss

### ‚ùå Without Firebase Set Up:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Data resets on each redeployment
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Users/products disappear after redeploy
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Only works until next deployment

---

## üéØ Summary

**Before pushing to GitHub:**
1. ‚úÖ Code is ready
2. ‚úÖ Firebase code supports environment variables
3. ‚úÖ Fallback to JSON files if Firebase fails

**On Vercel:**
1. Add `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`, `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL`, `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY`
2. Add `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
3. Deploy
4. Verify in logs that Firebase initialized
5. Test admin login and products

**After deployment:**
- Everything works as it does locally
- Data persists forever
- New users see all features

---

## üÜò Need Help?

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Vercel deployment logs
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Check Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore Database to verify data is there
4. Test locally first (make sure Firebase works locally)
